	/**
	*	As noted above, this function sets the boundary cells at the outer edges of the this so they perfectly counteract their neighbors.
	*	There's a bit of oddness here which is, what is this b pramaeter? It can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, and each value has a special meaning which is not at all obvious. The answer lies is what kind of data can be passed into this function.
	*	
	*	We have four different kinds of data (x, y, and z velocities, plus density) floating around, and any of those four can be passed in to set_bnd. You may notice that this is exactly the number of values this parameter can have, and this is not a coincidence.
	*	
	*	Let's look at a boundary cell (horrible ASCII art warning):
	*	
	*	+---+---+
	*	|   |^  |
	*	|   |  |
	*	|   |  |
	*	+---+---+
	*	Here we're at the left edge of the this. The left cell is the boundary cell that needs to counteract its neighbor, the right cell. The right cell has a velocity that's up and to the left.
	*	The boundary cell's x velocity needs to be opposite its neighbor, but its y velocity needs to be equal to its neighbor. This will produce a result like so:
	*	
	*	+---+---+
	*	|  ^|^  |
	*	| / |  |
	*	|/  |  |
	*	+---+---+
	*	This counteracts the motion of the fluid which would take it through the wall, and preserves the rest of the motion. So you can see that what action is taken depends on which array we're dealing with; if we're dealing with x velocities, then we have to set the boundary cell's value to the opposite of its neighbor, but for everything else we set it to be the same.
	*	That is the answer to the mysterious b. It tells the function which array it's dealing with, and so whether each boundary cell should be set equal or opposite its neighbor's value.
	*	
	*	This function also sets corners. This is done very simply, by setting each corner cell equal to the average of its three neighbors.
