 *       2) current working directory.
 *       3) the usual search-paths ( PATH etc ).
 *
 *       Some thing to be wary of is that if you are using symbol-server functionality symsrv.dll MUST reside together with
 *       the dbghelp.dll that is loaded as dbghelp.dll will only load that from the same path as where it self lives.
 *
 * @note On windows .pdb search paths will be set in the same way as dbghelp-defaults + the current module (.exe) dir, i.e.:
 *       1) same path as the current module (.exe)
 *       2) current working directory.
 *       3) The _NT_SYMBOL_PATH environment variable.
 *       4) The _NT_ALTERNATE_SYMBOL_PATH environment variable.
 *
 * @note On platforms that support it debug-output can be enabled by defining the environment variable DBGTOOLS_SYMBOL_DEBUG_OUTPUT.
